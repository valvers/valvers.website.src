# 2010-02-03 - 2010-02-03 Cylinder Head Bolts Torque
I went to bolt the heads on and realised I didn't have a haynes or anything covering the X25XE. D'oh! So I'll note a few torque settings here along with an [X25XE service manual](/dl/engineering/vauxhall-v6-x25xe-c30xe-engine-course.pdf).

## Cylinder Head bolts

- Stage 1 - 18 lb. ft.
- Stage 2 - 90 Deg
- Stage 3 - 90 Deg
- Stage 4 - 90 Deg
- Stage 5 - 15 Deg

## Crank Sprocket Bolt

- Stage 1 - 185 lb. ft.
- Stage 2 - 45 Deg
- Stage 3 - 15 Deg

:::note Need something good to lock the flywheel!!
